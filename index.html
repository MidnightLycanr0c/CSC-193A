    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This site isn't affiliated with <a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> or any of its subsidiaries. This is a user-created project designed for other Vine users because Amazon doesn't generate very useful itemized reports. Spreadsheets are boring though, so here's a picture of a dragon.</p>
